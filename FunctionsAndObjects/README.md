ARRAY: [1,6,23,8,4,8,3,7]

1. Create a function that returns the sum of all elements passed in array as parameter. Function (array)=>number
2. Create a function that returns sum of first and last elements of given array.
3. Create a function that takes a number and return factorial of that number.
4. Create a function that returns given array in reverse order. // no build in functions 
5. Create a function that based on given array returns new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e,f] -> [a+b, c+d, e+f][1,3,4,1,0,3] => [4,5,3] function(array)=>array
6. For time of this example remove last element from the given array. Create a function that based on given array return new array in pattern [a,b,c,d,e] -> [a+b, c+d, e+e]
7. Create a function the return one random element from given array. // use random function
8. Create a function that takes two parameters: array and number off attempts. Based on number of attempts choose a random number from table that many times and return lowest one.
9. Create a function that takes given array. Then takes a random element, removes it from the array and pushes it to result arrays. This takes place as long as there are elements in source array.
10. Create a function that on given array will perform operation of adding or subtracting elements. Operation is to be chosen at random. And return a result.[a,b,c,d] =>(((a+-b)+-c)+-d)
11. Create a function that will return the current day name in Polish.
12. Create a function that tells us how many days till Friday
13. Create a function that take two numbers and return the object with 4 fields. Result on 4 basic arithmetic operations.
